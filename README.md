# LibrarayMnagagementProject

Welcome to the **Library Management Project** repository! This project is a console application with a text-based graphical user interface (GUI), creatively designed using text symbols to manage library operations. 

## Project Description

The Library Management Project is designed to emulate the functions of a library, allowing users to interact with a virtual library system. It offers the following features:

- **Add Book Information**: Add books to the library's collection, including book ID, title, author name, price, and issue status.

- **Display Book Information**: Search and display book information by entering the book ID. Get details like book name, price, and more.

- **List All Books by Author**: Search and list books by a specific author's name, providing details such as book name, price, and more.

- **List Unissued Books Count**: Determine the count of unissued books available in the library.

- **Sort Books by ID**: Sort the library's book collection in ascending order based on book IDs.

- **Save Books Information**: Save all the book information to a file named 'books.txt' for future reference.

- **Load Books Information**: Load book data from the 'books.txt' file into the library system.

- **Exit**: Close the library management application.

The GUI of this console application uses text symbols creatively to provide a unique and enjoyable user experience. Navigate through the library's functions using intuitive text-based menus and commands.
